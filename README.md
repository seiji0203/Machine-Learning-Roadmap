A roadmap connecting many of the most important concepts in machine learning, how to learn them and what tools to use to perform them.

Namely:
```
😏Machine Learning Problems - what does a machine learning problem look like?
😎Machine Learning Process - once you’ve found a problem, what steps might you take to solve it?
👍Machine Learning Tools - what should you use to build your solution?
🧐Machine Learning Mathematics - what exactly is happening under the hood of all the machine learning code you're writing?
😗Machines Learning Resources - okay, this is cool, how can I learn all of this?
```

Many of the materials in this roadmap were inspired by Daniel Formoso's machine learning mindmaps, and then Daniel Bourke’s machine-learning-roadmap, so if you enjoyed this one, go and check out his. And also Daniel Formoso has a mindmap specifically for deep learning too.
